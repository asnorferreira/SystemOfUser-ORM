## Project Overview
The SystemUser project aims to provide a comprehensive user management system for web applications. It includes features such as user registration, authentication, authorization, and role management. The project is built using TypeScript and relies on the Express.js framework for the backend and TypeORM for database interaction.

## Technologies Used
The SystemUser project utilizes the following technologies:
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js used for building APIs and web applications.
- **TypeORM**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript and JavaScript that supports multiple database systems.
- **npm**: Node Package Manager for managing project dependencies and scripts.
